### About
*rvenv* (Remote Virtual Environment) is a minimalist, portable shell layer that turns any terminal into your personal sanctuary. it’s about carrying your identity, your configurations, and your tools in one encrypted vault.

### The Philosophy

- **Zero Friction**: No more manual <kbd>.env</kbd> files or messy <kbd>.bashrc</kbd> edits.

- **Total Privacy**: Your keys live in an encrypted vault, injected only into your active session.

- **Clean Living**: When you exit <kbd>rvenv</kbd>, your machine is exactly as you left it. No ghost files, no leftover paths.

### Why rvenv?
Standard environments manage *code*. **rvenv** manages *you*. It bridges the gap between a fresh terminal and a fully productive workspace in seconds, keeping your digital life organized and your local system light.
